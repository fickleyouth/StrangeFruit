Wells’s <i>A Red Record</i> Project Documentation</h2>\r\n<div id="accordion">\r\n<h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Ida B. Wells was an investigative reporter during the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century.  Wells, along with Nellie Bly, is considered one of the first female investigative reporters and a pioneer in the investigative reporting tradition that began with the other muckrakers of the late nineteenth century American journalism. After a family friend, Thomas Moss was lynched, Wells wrote an editorial piece, “Eight Men Lynched” in <i>Free Speech and Headlight</i>, a Memphis newspaper that she co-owned. Her editorial incited death threats and she left Memphis for Chicago, the city with which she would become most closely associated. The lynching of Thomas Moss is most of cited as the spark to Wells’s anti-lynching campaign and the subject of most her writings. From 1892 to 1900, Wells published numerous newspaper articles and three anti-lynching pamphlets: <i>Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases</i> (1892), <i>A Red Record</i>(1895), and <i>Mob Rule in New Orleans</i> (1900). For the completion of the my Master’s Thesis Project and a requirement of graduation from Loyola University Chicago’s Master of Arts in Digital Humanities program, I have chosen to create a digital project from Wells <i>A Red Record</i>.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Project Description</h3>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>\r\nThe inspiration for this project is three-fold: to highlight the contributions of Ida B. Wells, one of the first female and African American investigative reporters, to create a research tool to study the culture, laws, and victims of lynching in the United States, and an attempt of remediation; in this case remediating a late 19th century text into a digital tool which a twenty-first century researcher would be recognize and feel comfortable using. As researcher with a library and information science Master’s degree–a scholar-librarian– my goal of the project was to develop a remediated tool that allowed greater access to information and attempt to bridge the gap of the dissemination of information from the nineteenth century to the twenty-first century.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOften in the world of black political thought and African American Studies, the timeline of important figures goes from Frederick Douglass to Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. DuBois, to Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., and Malcolm X. The female leaders of the African American struggle for human rights are conspicuously missing from this discourse, and if they are mentioned,  its only for a fleeting moment. One of the best examples of the influence of the race women is comparing Ida B. Wells’ musings on self-defense with those of Malcolm X, some 70 years later. Ida B. Wells in her publication Southern Horrors wrote:\r\n</p><p>\r\n	“The lesson this teaches and which every Afro-American should ponder well, is that a Winchester rifle should have a place of honor in every black home, and it should be used for that protection which the law refuses to give.”  \r\nThis rationale is later echoed in Malcolm X’s famous 1964  speech, “The Ballot or The Bullet”:\r\n</p><p>\r\n“The only thing that I''ve ever said is that in areas where the government has proven itself either unwilling or unable to  defend the lives  and the property of Negroes, it''s time for Negroes to defend themselves. “\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe connection between Ida B. Wells and Malcolm X is not often remarked upon. In undergraduate courses, Malcolm X is attributed with the development of this school of thought on self-defense  with no acknowledgement for Wells. A project such as this would spark a new interest in Ida B. Wells’s work and piggy back on her recent induction into the Chicago Public Library’s Chicago Literary Hall of Fame.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Project Design</h3>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>\r\nThis project features an easy-to-navigate, clean website design with an simple search design and an interactive geographic information systems component. The audience of this project is college undergraduates and professors interested in incorporating this project into their class. My attempt in remediating the <i>A Red Record</i> is to advocate the use of digital pedagogy into research instruction classes and the use of digital projects to facilitate historical research and understanding. The framework was built in Digital Humanities 402 using Javascript, CSS, JQuery, PHP, and a MYSQL database to build a historical digital tool. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDigital projects in African American Studies can help to lend authority to the discipline which is a relatively recent discipline compared to Classics, Comparative Literature, Art History, among others. To encourage pluralism and diversity in research topics, and consequently change the discourse and timeline of important figures, technology is one of the best conduits to accomplish this goal. Through technology information can be more widely disseminated. Digital Humanities projects ease the temporal, geographic, and monetary burdens of humanities scholars to complete research. However, more than just make research easier for scholars, Digital Humanities projects also enhance research through analysis. Digital humanities allow for an almost instantaneous or fluid analysis of the data displayed. The Red Record Online will use GIS to achieve such analysis. The user may look at a map to view just a singular lynching event, or see all the lynchings that occurred in a state, town, year, month, or day. The other component of the project, digitized pages of The Red Record, will allow users to see a particular instance of lynching in context with the other lynchings that Ida B. Wells’s investigated.\r\n</p><p>\r\nStrange Fruit required cooperation among several different institutions, including Loyola University’s Center for Textual Studies and Digital Humanities and University of Chicago’s Special Collections Center. This combined effort will improve and strengthen the Digital Humanities field but also the African American Studies and the Library and Information Science disciplines. Working together builds a closer community and powerful network to achieve greater advancements in the application of technology in humanities research.\r\n</p><p>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>Project Conclusions</h3>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>My hope is to have this project continue on  after I have graduated. I hope my future employers will allow me to continue my work on this project. My next goals for this project are individual records for each lynching victim named in <i>A Red Record</i>, recode the text in XML-TEI. \r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>\r\nBibliography\r\n</h3>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>\r\nCarby, Hazel V.

The bloodhound was\r\nput across the river in the boat, and he struck a trail again\r\nat Bird''s Point on the Missouri side, ran about three hun-\r\ndred yards to the cottage of a white farmer named Grant\r\nand there lay down refusing to go further.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThursday morning a brakesman on a freight train going\r\nout of Sikeston, Mo., discovered a Negro stealing a ride; he\r\nordered him off and had hot words which terminated in a\r\nfight. The brakesman had the Negro arrested. When\r\narrested, between 11 and 12 o''clock, he had on a dark woolen\r\nshirt, light pants and coat, and no vest. He had twelve\r\ndollars in paper, two silver dollars and ninety-ﬁve cents\r\nin change; he had also four rings in his pockets, a knife and\r\na razor which were rusted and stained. The Sikeston\r\nauthorities immediately jumped to the conclusion that this\r\nman was the murderer for whom the Kentuckians across\r\nthe river were searching. They telegraphed to Bardwell\r\nthat their prisoner had on no coat, but wore a blue vest and\r\npants which would perhaps correspond with the coat found\r\nat the scene of the murder, and that the names of the mur-\r\ndered girls were in the rings found in his possession.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs soon as this news was received, the sheriffs of Bal-\r\nlard and Carlisle counties and a posse (?) of thirty well\r\narmed and determined Kentuckians, who had pledged their\r\nword the prisoner should be taken back to the scene of the\r\nsupposed crime, to be executed there if proved to be the\r\nguilty man, chartered a train and at nine o''clock Thursday\r\nnight started for Sikeston. Arriving there two hours later,\r\nthe sheriff at Sikeston, who had no warrant for the prisoner''s\r\narrest and detention, delivered him into the hands of the\r\nmob without authority for so doing, and accompanied them\r\nto Bird''s Point. The prisoner gave his name as Miller, his\r\nhome at Springﬁeld, and said he had never been in Ken-\r\ntucky in his life, but the sheriff turned him over to the mob\r\nto be taken to Wickliffe, that Frank Gordon, the fisherman,\r\nwho had put a man across the river might identify him.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn other words, the protection of the law was with-\r\ndrawn from C. J. Miller, and he was given to a mob by this\r\nsheriff at Sikeston, who knew that the prisoner''s life depend-\r\ned on one man''s word. After an altercation with the train\r\nmen, who wanted another $50 for taking the train back to\r\nBird''s Point, the crowd arrived there at three o''clock, Fri-\r\nday morning.

If, however, he is mentally unbalanced, irresponsible for his acts, there can be no more inhuman act\r\nconceived of than the willful sacrifice of his life.

The victims of this tragedy were a\r\ncolored man, named Hamp Biscoe, his wife and a thirteen\r\nyear-old son.

He says the\r\noriginal trouble which led to the lynching was a quarrel\r\nbetween Biscoe and a white man about a debt. About six\r\nyears after Biscoe pre—empted his land, a white man made a\r\ndemand of $100 upon him for services in showing him the\r\nland and making the sale. Biscoe denied the service and\r\nrefused to pay the demand.

A week preceding the tragedy, a white man\r\nnamed Venable, whose farm adjoined Biscoe''s, let down the\r\nfence and proceeded to drive through Biscoe’s ﬁeld. The\r\nlatter saw him; grew very excited, cursed him and drove\r\nhim from his farm with bitter oaths and violent \r\nVenable went away and secured a warrant for \r\narrest. This warrant was placed in the hands of a constable\r\nJohn Ford, who took a colored deputy and two white\r\nmen out to Biscoe''s farm to make the arrest. When they\r\narrived at the house Biscoe refused to be arrested and\r\nwarned them he would shoot if they persisted in \r\nattempt to arrest him. The warning was unheeded by Ford,\r\nwho entered upon the premises, when Biscoe, true to his\r\nword, ﬁred upon him. The load tore a part of his clothes\r\nfrom his body, one shot going through his arm and entering\r\nhis breast. After he had fallen, Ford drew his revolver and\r\nshot Biscoe in the head and his wife through the arm. The\r\nNegro deputy then began ﬁring and struck Biscoe in the\r\nsmall of the back. Ford''s wound was not dangerous and in\r\na few days he was able to be around again. Biscoe, however,\r\nwas so severely shot that he was unable to stand after the\r\nﬁring was over.\r\n</p><p>\r\nTwo other white men hearing the exchange of shots\r\nwent to the rescue of the officers, forced open the door of\r\nBiscoe‘s cabin and arrested him, his wife and thirteen-year-\r\nold son, and took them, together with a babe at the breast,\r\nto a small frame house near the depot and put them‘,\r\nguard.

But that night, about 8 o’clock, a party of perhaps\r\ntwelve or ﬁfteen men, a number of whom were known to the\r\nguards, came to the house and told the Negro guards they\r\nwould take care of the prisoners now, and for them to leave;\r\nas they did not obey at once they were persuaded to leave\r\nwith words that did not admit of delay.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe woman began to cry and said, ''You intend to kill\r\nus to get our money.'' They told her to hush (she was heavy\r\nwith child and had a child at her breast) as they intended\r\nto give her a nice present. The guards heard no more, but\r\nhastened to a Negro church near by and urged the preacher\r\nto go up and stop the mob. A few minutes after, the shoot-\r\ning began, perhaps about forty shots being ﬁred. The white\r\nmen then left rapidly and the Negroes went to the house.\r\nHamp Biscoe and his wife were killed, the baby had a slight\r\nwound across the upper lip; the boy was still alive and lived\r\nuntil after midnight, talking rationally and telling who did\r\nthe shooting.\r\n </p><p>\r\n"He said when they came in and shot his father, he\r\nattempted to run out of doors and a young man shot him\r\nin the bowels and that he fell. He saw another man shoot\r\nhis mother and a taller young man, whom he did not know,\r\nshoot his father. After they had killed them, the young\r\nman who had shot his mother pulled off her stockings and\r\ntook $220 in currency that she had hid there. The men then\r\ncame to the door where the boy was lying and one of them\r\nturned him over and put his pistol to his breast and shot\r\nhim again. This is the story the dying boy told as near\r\nas I can get it. It is quite singular that the guards and those\r\nwho had conversed with him were not required to testify.\r\nThe woman was known to have the money as she had ex-\r\nposed it that day.

The cause of this awful outbreak of human\r\npassion was the murder of a four year old child, daughter\r\nof a man named Vance. This man, Vance, had been a police\r\nofficer in Paris for years, and was known to be a man of bad\r\ntemper, overbearing manner and given to harshly treating\r\nthe prisoners under his care. He had arrested Smith and,\r\nit is said, cruelly mistreated him. Whether or not the\r\nmurder of his child was an act of fiendish revenge, it has\r\nnot been shown, but many persons who know of the incident\r\nhave suggested that the secret of the attack on the child\r\nlay in a desire for revenge against its father.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn the same town there lived a Negro, named Henry\r\nSmith, a well known character, a kind of roustabout,who was\r\ngenerally considered a harmless, weak—minded fellow, not\r\ncapable of doing any important work, but sufficiently able to\r\ndo chores and odd jobs around the houses of the white people\r\nwho cared to employ him. A few days before the final trag-\r\nedy, this man, Smith, was accused of murdering Myrtle\r\nVance. The crime of murder was of itself bad enough, and\r\nto prove that against Smith would have been amply suffi-\r\ncient in Texas to have committed him to the gallows, but the\r\nfinding of the child so exasperated the father and his friends,\r\nthat they at once shamefully exaggerated the facts and de-\r\nclared that the babe had been ruthlessly assaulted and then\r\nkilled. The truth was bad enough, but the white people of\r\nthe community made it a point to exaggerate every detail\r\nof the awful affair, and to inflame the public mind so that\r\nnothing less than immediate and violent death would satisfy\r\nthe populace. As a matter of fact, the child was not bru-\r\ntally assaulted as the world has been told in excuse for the\r\nawful barbarism of that day. Persons who saw the child\r\nafter its death, have stated, under the most solemn pledge\r\nto truth, that there was no evidence of such an assault as\r\nwas published at that time, only a slight abrasion and dis-\r\ncoloration was noticeable and that mostly about the neck.\r\nIn spite of this fact, so eminent a man as Bishop Haygood\r\ndeliberately and, it must also appear, maliciously falsiﬁed\r\n', 'p25.jpg', '', '2014-04-07 15:17:00'),

He was\r\njailed for six months, discharged, and is now a detective in\r\nthat city. In the same city, last May, a white man outraged\r\na colored girl in a drug store. He was arrested and re-\r\nleased on bail at the trial. It was rumored that five hundred\r\ncolored men had organized to lynch him. Two hundred and\r\nfifty white citizens armed themselves with Winchesters and\r\nguarded him.

Two years ago\r\nI made an effort to have him put in an asylum, but the white\r\npeople were trying to fasten the murder of a young colored\r\ngirl upon him, and would not listen. For days before the\r\nmurder of the little Vance girl, Smith was out of his head\r\nand dangerous. He had just undergone an attack of delirium\r\ntremens and was in no condition to be allowed at large. He\r\nrealized his condition, for I spoke with him not three weeks\r\nago, and in answer to my exhortations, he promised to\r\nreform.

A colored man\r\nnamed Daniel Edwards, lived near Selma, Alabama, and\r\nworked for a family of a farmer near that place. This re-\r\nsulted in an intimacy between the young man and a daugh-\r\nter of the householder, which ﬁnally developed in the\r\ndisgrace of the girl. After the birth of the child, the mother\r\ndisclosed the fact that Edwards was its father. The rela-\r\ntionship had been sustained for more than a year, and yet\r\nthis colored man was apprehended, thrown into jail from\r\nwhence he was taken by a mob of one hundred neighbors\r\nand hung to a tree and his body riddled with bullets. A\r\ndispatch which describes the lynching, ends as follows.\r\n“Upon his back was found pinned this morning the follow-\r\ning: ‘Warning to all Negroes that are too intimate with\r\nwhite girls. This the work of one hundred best citizens of\r\nthe South Side.’ ”\r\n</p><p>\r\nThere can be no doubt from the announcement made\r\nby this “one hundred best citizens” that they understood\r\nfull well the character of the relationship which existed\r\nbetween Edwards and the girl, but when the dispatches\r\nwere sent out, describing the affair, it was claimed that\r\nEdwards was lynched for rape.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSUPPRESSING THE TRUTH.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn a county in Mississippi during the month of July the\r\nAssociated Press dispatches sent out a report that the\r\nsheriff’s eight year old daughter had been assaulted by a big,\r\nblack, burly brute who had been promptly lynched. The\r\nfacts which have since been investigated show that the girl\r\nwas more than eighteen years old and that she was dis-\r\ncovered by her father in this young man''s room who was a\r\nservant on the place. But these facts the Associated Press\r\nhas not given to the world, nor did the same agency acquaint\r\nthe world with the fact that a Negro youth who was\r\nlynched in Tuscumbia, Ala., the same year on the same\r\ncharge told the white girl who accused him before the mob,\r\nthat he had met her in the woods often by appointment.\r\nThere is a young mulatto in one of the State prisons of the\r\nSouth to-day who is there by charge of a young white woman\r\nto screen herself.

Several\r\ninstances of this spirit have occurred in the year past. In\r\nLouisiana, near New Orleans, in July, 1893, Roselius Julian,\r\na colored man, shot and killed a white judge, named Victor\r\nEstopinal. The cause of the shooting has never been\r\ndefinitely ascertained. It is claimed that the Negro resented\r\nan insult to his wife, and the killing of the white man was\r\nan act of a Negro (who dared) to defend his home. The\r\njudge was killed in the court house, and Julian, heavily\r\narmed, made his escape to the swamps near the city. He\r\nhas never been apprehended, nor has any information ever\r\nbeen gleaned as to his whereabouts. A mob determined to\r\nsecure the fugitive murderer and burn him alive. The\r\nswamps were hunted through and through in vain, when,\r\nbeing unable to wreak their revenge upon the murderer, the\r\nmob turned its attention to his unfortunate relatives. Dis-\r\npatches from New Orleans, dated September 19, 1893, de-\r\nscribed the affair as follows:\r\n</p><p>\r\n"Posses were immediately organized and the surround-\r\ning country was scoured, but the search was fruitless so far\r\nas the real criminal was concerned. The mother, three\r\nbrothers and two sisters of the Negro were arrested yester-\r\nday at the Black Ridge in the rear of the city by the police\r\nand taken to the little jail on Judge Estopinal''s place about\r\nSouthport, because of the belief that they were succoring\r\nthe fugitive.\r\n</p><p>\r\n"About 11 o''clock twenty-five men, some armed with\r\nrifles and shotguns, came up to the jail. They unlocked\r\nthe door and held a conference among themselves as to\r\nwhat they should do. Some were in favor of hanging the\r\nfive, while others insisted that only two of the brothers\r\n</p>', 'p33.jpg', '', '2014-04-15 16:27:19'),

This was finally agreed to, and the\r\ntwo doomed negroes were hurried to a pasture one hundred\r\nyards distant, and there asked to take their last chance of\r\nsaving their lives by making a confession, but the Negroes\r\nmade no reply. They were then told to kneel down and\r\npray. One did so, the other remained standing, but both\r\nprayed fervently. The taller Negro was then hoisted up.\r\nThe shorter Negro stood gazing at the horrible death of his\r\nbrother without ﬂinching. Five minutes later he was also\r\nhanged. The mob decided to take the remaining brother\r\nout to Camp Parapet and hang him there. The other two\r\nwere to be taken out and flogged, with an order to get out\r\nof the parish in less than half an hour. The third brother,\r\nPaul, was taken out to the camp, which is about a mile\r\ndistant in the interior, and there he was hanged to a tree."\r\n</p><p>\r\nAnother young man, who was in no way related to\r\nJulian, who perhaps did not even know the man and who\r\nwas entirely innocent of any offense in connection there-\r\nwith, was murdered by the same mob. The same paper\r\nsays:\r\n</p><p>\r\n"During the search for Julian on Saturday one branch\r\nof the posse visited the house of a Negro family in the\r\nneighborhood of Camp Parapet, and failing to ﬁnd the\r\nobject of their search, tried to induce John Willis, a young\r\nNegro, to disclose the whereabouts of Julian. He refused\r\nto do so, or could not do so, and was kicked to death by the\r\ngang."\r\n</p><p>\r\nAN INDIANA CASE. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAlmost equal to the ferocity of the mob which killed the\r\nthree brothers, Julian and the unoffending, John Willis,\r\nbecause of the murder of Judge Estopinal, was the action of\r\na mob near Vincennes, Ind. In this case a wealthy colored\r\nman, named Allen Butler, who was well known in the com-\r\nmunity, and enjoyed the conﬁdence and respect of the"\r\nentire country, was made the victim of a mob and hung\r\nbecause his son had become unduly intimate with a white\r\ngirl who was a servant around his house.

There was a loud yell, and a rush\r\nwas made for the prisoner. He was stripped naked, his\r\nclothing literally torn from his body, and his shirt was tied\r\naround his loins. Some one declared the rope was a "white\r\nman''s death," and a log-chain, nearly a hundred feet in\r\nlength, weighing over one hundred pounds, was placed\r\nround Miller''s neck and body, and he was led and dragged\r\nthrough the streets of the village in that condition followed\r\nby thousands of people.

This\r\nRoanoke case is a double refutation, for it not only disproves\r\nthe alleged charge’ that the Negro assaulted a white woman,\r\nas was telegraphed all over the country at the time, but it\r\nalso shows conclusively that even in one of the largest\r\ncities of the old state of Virginia, one of the original thirteen\r\ncolonies, which prides itself of being the mother of presi-\r\ndents, it was possible for a lynching to occur in broad day-\r\nlight under circumstances of revolting savagery.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhen the news first came from Roanoke of the con-\r\ntemplated lynching, it was stated that a big burly Negro\r\nhad assaulted a white woman, that he had been apprehended\r\nand that the citizens were determined to summarily dispose\r\n</p>\r\n   \r\n \r\n  \r\n   \r\n   \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n  \r\n  \r\n \r\n  \r\n    \r\n   \r\n  \r\n   \r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n   \r\n  \r\n', 'p45.jpg', '', '2014-04-26 16:19:28'),

It evidently thought that it was only another \r\ncase of swagger, such as frequently characterizes lynching\r\nepisodes.

Thousands of persons visited the scene of the\r\nlynching between daylight and eight o''clock when the body\r\nwas cut down.

After the killing of Jackson, the\r\ninquest was continued to ascertain the possible connection\r\nof the other persons charged with the crime. Against the\r\nwife and mother—in-law of the unfortunate man there was\r\nnot the slightest evidence and the coroner''s jury was fair\r\nenough to give them their liberty. They were declared\r\ninnocent and returned. to their homes. But this did not pro-\r\ntect the women from the demands of the Christian white\r\npeople of that section of the country. In any other land and\r\nwith any other people, the fact that these two accused\r\npersons were women would have pleaded in their favor for\r\nprotection and fair play, but that had no weight with the\r\nMississippi Christians nor the further fact that a jury of\r\nwhite men had declared them innocent. The hanging of\r\none victim on an unproven charge did not begin to satisfy\r\nthe mob in its bloodthirsty demands and the result was that\r\neven after the women had been discharged, they were at\r\nonce taken in charge by a mob, which hung them by the\r\nneck until they were dead.\r\n</p><p>\r\nStill the mob was not satisfied. During the coroner’s\r\ninvestigation the name of a fourth person, Rufus Bigley,\r\nwas mentioned. He was acquainted with the Jacksons and\r\nthat fact, together with some testimony adduced at the in-\r\nquest, prompted the mob to decide that he should die also.\r\nSearch was at once made for him and the next day he was\r\napprehended. He was not given over into the hands of the\r\ncivil authorities for trial nor did the coroner''s inquest find\r\nthat he was guilty, but the mob was quite sufficient in itself.\r\nAfter finding Bigley, he was strung up to a tree and his\r\nbody left hanging, where it was found next day. It may be\r\nremarked here in passing that this instance of the moral\r\ndegradation of the people of Mississippi did not excite any\r\ninterest in the public at large. American Christianity heard\r\nof this awful affair and read of its details and neither press\r\nnor pulpit gave the matter more than a passing comment.\r\nHad it occurred in the wilds of interior Africa, there would\r\nhave been an outcry from the humane people of this country\r\nagainst the savagery which would so mercilessly put men\r\nand women to death. But it was an evidence of American\r\ncivilization to be passed by unnoticed, to be denied or condoned as the requirements of any future emergency might\r\ndetermine.\r\n</p>\r\n', 'p49.jpg', '', '2014-04-26 16:19:28'),

Memphis is one of the queen\r\ncities of the south, with a population of about seventy\r\nthousand souls—easily one of the twenty largest, most\r\nprogressive and wealthiest cities of the United States.

While hunting\r\nhim they shot another Negro dead in his tracks for refusing\r\nto stop when ordered to do so. After a few days Lee\r\nWalker was found, and put in jail in Memphis until the\r\nmob there was ready for him.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe Memphis Commercial of Sunday, July 23, contains\r\na full account of the tragedy from which the following ex-\r\ntracts are made:\r\n</p><p>\r\nAt 12 o’clock last night. Lee Walker, who attempted to\r\noutrage Miss Mollie McCadden, last Tuesday morning, was \r\ntaken from the county jail and hanged to a telegraph pole\r\njust north of the prison. All day rumors were aﬂoat that\r\nwith nightfall an attack would be made upon the jail, and\r\nas everyone anticipated that a vigorous resistance would be\r\nmade, a conflict between the mob and the authorities was\r\nfeared.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAt 10 o''clock Capt. O’Haver, Sergt. Horan and several\r\npatrolmen were on hand. but they could do nothing with the\r\ncrowd. An attack by the mob was made on the door in the\r\nsouth wall, and it yielded. Sheriff McLendon and several\r\nof his men threw‘ themselves into the breach, but two or\r\nthree of the storming party shoved by. They were seized\r\nby the police, but were not subdued, the officers refraining\r\nfrom using their clubs. The entire mob might at first have\r\nbeen dispersed by ten policemen who would use their clubs,\r\nbut the sheriff insisted that no violence be done.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe mob got an iron rail and used it as a battering ram\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n', 'p50.jpg', '', '2014-04-26 16:19:28'),

Still he counseled moderation and would not order\r\nhis deputies and the police to disperse the crowd by force.\r\nThe paciﬁc policy of the sheriff impressed the mob with the\r\nidea that the officers were afraid, or at least would do them\r\nno harm, and they redoubled their efforts, urged on by a\r\nbig switchman. At 12 o‘clock the door of the prison was\r\nbroken in with a rail.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs soon as the rapist was brought out of the door calls\r\nwere heard for a rope; then some one shouted, “Burn him!"\r\nBut there was no time to make a ﬁre. When Walker got into\r\nthe lobby a dozen of the men began beating and stabbing\r\nhim. He was half dragged, half carried to the corner of\r\nFront street and the alley between Sycamore and Mill, and\r\nhung to a telegraph pole.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWalker made a desperate resistance. Two men entered\r\nhis cell first and ordered him to come forth. He refused,\r\nand they failing to drag him out, others entered. He\r\nscratched and bit his assailants, wounding several of them\r\nseverely with his teeth. The mob retaliated by striking and\r\ncutting him with fists and knives. When he reached the\r\nsteps leading down to the door he made another stand and\r\nwas stabbed again and again. By the time he reached the\r\nlobby his power to resist was gone, and he was shoved along\r\nthrough the mob of yelling, cursing men and boys, who beat,\r\nspat upon and slashed the wretch-like demon.

A hastily improvised\r\nnoose was slipped over the Negro’s head, and several young\r\nmen mounted a pile of lumber near the pole and threw the\r\nrope over one of the iron stepping pins. The Negro was\r\nlifted up until his feet were three feet above the ground,\r\nthe rope was made taut, and a corpse dangled in midair. A\r\nbig fellow who helped lead the mob pulled the Negro’s legs\r\nuntil his neck cracked.

The body was per-\r\nmitted to hang for half an hour, then it was cut down and\r\nthe rope divided among those who lingered around the\r\nscene of the tragedy. Then it was suggested that the corpse\r\nbe burned, and it was done. The entire performance, from\r\nthe assault on the jail to the burning of the dead Negro was\r\nwitnessed by a score or so of policemen and as many deputy\r\nsheriffs, but not a hand was lifted to stop the proceedinges\r\nafter the jail door yielded.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs the body hung to the telegraph pole, blood streaming\r\ndown from the knife wounds in his neck, his hips and lower\r\npart of his legs also slashed with knives, the crowd hurled\r\nexpletives at him, swung the body so that it was dashed\r\nagainst the pole, and, so far from the ghastly sight proving\r\ntrying to the nerves, the crowd looked on with complaisance,if not with real pleasure. The Negro died hard. The\r\nneck was not broken, as the body was drawn up without\r\nbeing given a fall, and death came by strangulation. For\r\nfully ten minutes after he was strung up the chest heaved\r\noccasionally, and there were convulsive movements of the\r\nlimbs. Finally he was pronounced dead, and a few minutes\r\nlater Detective Richardson climbed on a pile of staves and\r\ncut the rope. The body fell in a ghastly heap, and the crowd\r\nlaughed at the sound and crowded around the prostrate body,\r\na few kicking the inanimate carcass.\r\n</p><p>\r\nDetective Richardson, who is also a deputy coroner, then\r\nproceeded to impanel the following jury of inquest: J.

If no witnesses are forthcoming, the\r\njury will be able to arrive at a verdict just the same, as all\r\nmembers of it saw the lynching. Then some one raised the\r\ncry of “Burn him!” It was quickly taken up and soon re-\r\nsounded from a hundred throats. Detective Richardson, for a\r\nlong time, single-handed, stood the crown off. He talked and\r\nbegged the men not to bring disgrace on the city by burning\r\nthe body, arguing that all the vengeance possible had been ,\r\nwrought.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile this was going on a small crowd was busy starting\r\na. fire in the middle of the street.

There was a\r\ncry for more wood, as the ﬁre had begun to die owing to the\r\nlong delay. Willing hands procured the wood, and it was\r\npiled up on the Negro, almost, for a time, obscuring him from\r\nview. The head was in plain view, as also were the limbs,\r\nand one arm which stood out high above the body, the elbow\r\ncrooked, held in that position by a stick of wood. In a few\r\nmoments the hands began to swell, then came great blisters\r\nover all the exposed parts of the body; then in places the\r\nflesh was burned away and the bones began to show through.\r\nIt was a horrible sight, one which, perhaps, none there had\r\never witnessed before.

Two\r\nor three white women, accompanied by their escorts, pushed\r\nto the front to obtain an unobstructed view, and looked on\r\nwith astonishing coolness and nonchalance. One man and\r\nWoman brought a little girl, not over 12 years old, apparent-\r\nly their daughter, to view a scene which was calculated to\r\ndrive sleep from the child''s eyes for many nights, if not\r\nto produce a permanent injury to her nervous system. The\r\ncomments of the crowd were varied. Some remarked on the\r\nefficacy of this style of cure for rapists, others rejoiced that\r\nmen''s wives and daughters were now safe from this wretch.\r\nSome laughed as the flesh cracked and blistered, and while\r\na large number pronounced the burning of a dead body as\r\na useless episode, not in all that throng was a word of sympathy heard for the wretch himself.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe rope that was used to hang the Negro, and also that\r\nwhich was used to lead him from the jail, were eagerly\r\nsought by relic hunters.

It is certain that lynch-\r\ning mobs have not only refused to give the Negro a chance\r\nto defend himself, but have killed their victim with a full\r\nknowledge that the relationship of the alleged assailant\r\nwith the woman who accused him, was voluntary and\r\nclandestine. As a matter of fact, one of the prime causes of\r\nthe Lynch Law agitation has been a necessity for defending\r\nthe Negro from this awful charge against him. This de-\r\nfense has been necessary because the apologists for outlawry\r\ninsist that in no case has the accusing woman been a willing\r\nconsort of her paramour, who is lynched because overtaken\r\nin wrong. It is well known, however, that such is the case.\r\nIn July of this year, 1894, John Paul Bocock, a Southern\r\nwhite man living in New York. and assistant editor of the\r\nNew York Tribune, took occasion to defy the publication of\r\nany instance where the lynched Negro was the victim of a\r\nwhite woman’s falsehood. Such cases are not rare. but the\r\npress and people conversant with the facts, almost invari-\r\nably suppress them.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe New York Sun of July 30th, 1894, contained a\r\nsynopsis of interviews with leading congressmen and\r\neditors of the South. Speaker Crisp, of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, who was recently a Judge of the Supreme\r\nCourt of Georgia, led in declaring that lynching seldom or\r\nnever took place, save for vile crime against women and\r\nchildren. Dr. Hoss, editor of the leading organ of the\r\nMethodist Church South, published in its columns that it\r\nwas his belief that more than three hundred women had\r\nbeen assaulted by Negro men within three months.

This availed him nothing against the sworn testi-\r\nmony of a minister’s wife, a lady of the highest respect-\r\nability. He was found guilty, and entered the penitentiary,\r\nDecember 14, 1885, for fifteen years. Sometime afterwards\r\nthe woman’s remorse: led her to confess to her husband that\r\nthe man was innocent.

He had a strange\r\nfascination for me, and I invited him to call on me. He\r\ncalled, bringing chestnuts and candy for the children. By\r\nthis means we got them to leave us alone in the room. Then\r\nI sat on his lap. He made a proposal to me and I readily\r\nconsented. Why I did so I do not know, but that I did is\r\ntrue. He visited me several times after that and each time\r\nI was indiscreet. I did not care after the first time. In fact\r\nI could not have resisted, and had no desire to resist.”\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhen asked by her husband why she told him she had\r\nbeen outraged, she said: “I had several reasons for telling\r\nyou. One was the neighbors saw the fellow here, another\r\nwas, I was afraid I had contracted a loathsome disease, and\r\nstill another was that I feared I might give birth to a Negro\r\nbaby. I hoped to save my reputation by telling you a de-\r\nliberate lie." Her husband, horrified by the confession, had\r\nOffett. who had already served four years, released and\r\nsecured a divorce.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThere have been many such cases throughout the South,\r\nwith the difference that the Southern white men in insensate\r\nfur)‘ wreak their vengeance without intervention of law\r\nupon the Negro who consorts with their women.\r\n</p>', 'p60.jpg', '', '2014-04-26 17:38:58'),

Ledger, of June 8, 1892, has the\r\nfollowing: “If Lillie Bailey, a rather pretty white girl,\r\nseventeen years of age, who is now at the city hospital,\r\nwould be somewhat less reserved about her disgrace there\r\nwould be some very nauseating details in the story of her\r\nlife. She is the mother of a little coon. The truth might\r\nreveal fearful depravity or the evidence of a rank outrage.\r\nShe will not divulge the name of the man who has left such\r\nblack evidence of her disgrace, and in fact says it is a\r\nmatter in which there can be no interest to the outside world.\r\nShe came to Memphis nearly three months ago, and was\r\ntaken in at the Woman''s Refuge in the southern part of the\r\ncity. She remained there until a few weeks ago when the\r\nchild was born. The ladies in charge of the Refuge were\r\nhorrified. The girl was at once sent to the city hospital,\r\nwhere she has been since May 30th. She is a country girl.\r\nShe came to Memphis from her father’s farm, a short dis-\r\ntance from Hernando, Miss. Just when she left there she\r\nwould not say. In fact she says she came to Memphis from\r\nArkansas, and says her home is in that state. She is rather\r\ngood looking, has blue eyes, a low forehead and dark red\r\nhair. The ladies at the Woman''s Refuge do not know any-\r\nthing about the girl further than what they learned when\r\nshe was an inmate of the institution; and she would not tell\r\nmuch. When the child was born an attempt was made to\r\nget the girl to reveal the name of the Negro who had\r\ndisgraced her, she obstinately refused and it was impossible\r\nto elicit any information from her on the subject.”\r\n</p><p>\r\nNote the wording: “The truth might reveal fearful\r\ndepravity or rank outrage.” If it had been a white child or\r\nif Lillie Bailey had told a pitiful story of Negro outrage, it\r\nwould have been a case of Woman’s weakness or assault and\r\nshe could have remained at the Woman''s Refuge. But a\r\nNegro child and to withhold its father’s name and thus pre-\r\nvent the killing of another Negro “rapist” was a case of\r\n“fearful depravity.” Had she revealed the father’s name, he\r\nwould have been lynched and his taking off charged to an\r\nassault upon a white woman.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBURNED ALIVE FOR ADULTERY.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn Texarkana, Arkansas, Edward Coy was accused of\r\nassaulting a white woman.
